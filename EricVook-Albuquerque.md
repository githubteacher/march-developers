## Albuquerque, NM

### Great places to eat

#### Eat at El Pinto
- For Mexican food in a rural, ranch-style environment, visit El Pinto Restaurant
- It is north on I-25 
- My family has been going there for over 40 years before there was even a https://www.elpinto.com/ website.

### Fun things to do

#### Visit Sandia Peak
- Take the Sandia Peak Tramway to the top of the Sandia Mountains.
- Bring hiking shoes and a warm jacket to hike along the Crest Trail, even in the summer.
- The former High Finance restaurant at the top of the mountain is to be replaced in 2018, so I'm not sure what food is available at the top of the mountain now.

#### The Albuquerque acquarium is also nice.
- Again, you can eat great seafood after your visit
